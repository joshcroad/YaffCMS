Introduction
------------

Firstly, thank you for downloading and using YaffCMS. You can contribute to the project by forking the repository at [http://github.com/dcgauld/YaffCMS](http://github.com/dcgauld/YaffCMS).

As YaffCMS is a flat file CMS, there is no database to store pages and their content. Instead, simply creating a variety of `.txt` files will dynamically add content to your website.

Creating Pages
--------------

Within the 'pages' directory, each `.txt` file is treated as a seperate page. For example, if your website is located at `http://example.com`, `pages/products.txt` can be accessed at `http://example.com/products` and `pages/index.txt` can be accessed at `http://example.com`. URLs can be extended by creating subfolders, for example, `pages/category/product.txt` can be accessed at `http://example.com/category/product`.

A list of possible combinations is shown below:

* `pages/index.txt` --> `http://example.com`
* `pages/page.txt` --> `http://example.com/page`
* `pages/sub/index.txt` --> `http://example.com/sub` (same as above)
* `pages/sub/page.txt` --> `http://example.com/sub/page`
* `pages/a/stupid/amount.txt` --> `http://example.com/a/stupid/amount`

If a file cannot be found, `pages/404.txt` is displayed.

Page Markup
-----------

All `.txt` files are marked up using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and therefore can also contain HTML.

Meta can be applied to each page by adding a block comment at the top of the `.txt` file. A 'Page Title' can be added to add the name of the page in the browser's title bar, and 'Page Template' can be used to differentiate between different templates within the current them (detailed below). An example of the meta declaration is below:

	/ *
	Page Title: This is my page!
	Page Template: fullwidth
	*/

These values are added to the `$y` array (detailed below) and can be accessed from within the `.php` and `.txt` files.

$y
--

The `$y` variable is an array of values used throughout YaffCMS. These can be used within any theme file. A selection of available values are shown below:

* `$y['site_title']` - The title of your installation.
* `$y['base_url']` - The URL of your installation.
* `$y['theme']` - The name (slug) of the current theme.
* `$y['theme_url']` - The URL of the current theme.
* `$y['page_title']` - The current page's title.
* `$y['page_template']` - The current page's template.
* `$y['page_content']` - The current page's content.

Custom values can be added in the `settings.php` file in the root directory of your installation.

**All of these values (except for 'page\_content') can be accessed from within any `.txt` file. Just enclose the name of the value within '&#37;' symbols, e.g. if you would like to access `$y['page_title']`, &#37;page\_title&#37; must be used. This same syntax can be used with any custom values.**

Themes
------

A simple theming system is used to style pages in your installation. The minimum requirements of a theme is to contain just one file, `default.php` (the default page template).

Page templates can be easily added to a theme by creating a new `.php` file. If a new file called `product.php` is added, the 'Page Template' meta value (within a `.txt` file) will need to have the value of `product` to be used.
